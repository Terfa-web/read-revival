          My working career began in 1972 after graduating from St.Augustineâ€™s
          Teachers College Lafia. l taught in the Primary school for 18 months
          before proceeding for further studies. After serving in the NYSC
          program between 1976 and 1977, I became actively engaged in teaching
          English Language and Literature in various secondary schools across
          BENUE STATE. Between1981and1999 I served as Principal of some
          secondary schools in BENUE STATE. At the end of 1999 I moved from
          secondary schools to the Inspectorate department of the ministry of
          education where I first served as the Area Education Officer for
          VANDEIKYA LOCAL GOVT. My job here was to supervise teaching and
          learning activities in Primary and secondary schools in the local
          government. I served in two other local governments before finally
          moving to the Headquarters of the ministry of education Inspectorate
          department in charge of Zone C which comprises nine local governments.
          In 2010 I was promoted to the Rank of Director Inspectorate services.
          As a Director, my job involved coordinating the activities of the Area
          Education Offices in the 23 local governments in BENUE STATE;
          formulating and developing policies for the department; reporting to
          the government observed progress and challenges encountered by school
          administrators and teachers for necessary attention. I finally
          disengaged from service in August 2012 after completing the mandatory
          35 years of service.
